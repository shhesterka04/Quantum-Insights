We are given an oracle that knows all the entries of $k$ matrices, that is, we can query the oracle for an $(i, j)$ entry of the $l$-th matrix. The goal is to test if each pair of $k$ matrices commute with each other or not with as few queries to the oracle as possible.\n",

        "In order to solve this problem, we use a theorem of Mario Szegedy [Sze04b, Sze04a] that relates a hitting time of a classical random walk to that of a quantum walk. We also take a look at another method of quantum walk by Andris Ambainis [Amb04a]. We apply both walks into the triangle finding problem [MSS05] and matrix verification problem [BS05] to compare the powers of the two different walks. We also present Ambainis's method of lower bounding technique [Amb00] to obtain a lower bound for this problem. \n",

We give an $O(k^{4/5} n^{9/5})$ algorithm as well as a lower bound of $\\Omega(k^{1/2} n)$. We generalize the technique used in coming up with the upper bound to solve a broader range of similar problems. This is probably the first problem to be studied on the quantum query complexity."
