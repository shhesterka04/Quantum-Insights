For example, one could use tools from additive combinatorics or Fourier analysis to show that certain sets have high or low density, and use this to prove stronger lower bounds.\n",

Time-space tradeoffs: To prove a time-space tradeoff for the verification problem, one could adapt techniques from classical complexity theory, such as the time hierarchy theorem or space hierarchy theorem. These theorems provide a framework for proving time-space tradeoffs in classical computation, and similar techniques might be applicable to quantum computation as well.\n",

        "3. Polynomial method: The polynomial method is a powerful tool for proving lower bounds in algebraic complexity theory. It has been successfully used to prove lower bounds for classical algorithms for matrix multiplication, and it might be applicable to the quantum case as well. One could try to adapt the polynomial method to the verification problem to prove stronger lower bounds.\n",

        "4. New techniques: As with any open problem, new techniques and ideas are always welcome. Researchers could develop new tools and methods specifically designed for quantum computation, or adapt existing techniques from other areas of mathematics and computer science. These new ideas could potentially lead to breakthroughs in solving these open problems. \n",
