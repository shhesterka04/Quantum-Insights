        "**VQMC (Variational Quantum Monte Carlo)** is a method that is used to simulate quantum systems on quantum computers. It combines Monte Carlo methods and a variational method for an approximate solution of the system's Hamiltonian. VQMC uses a compact representation of the wave function using tensor networks, which are then optimized using classical and quantum optimization algorithms. The simulation results are evaluated by calculating the expected values of the system's Hamiltonian. VQMC can be used to simulate various quantum systems, including molecular systems, solid state systems, and others."
