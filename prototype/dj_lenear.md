The Deutsch-Josza algorithm is a quantum algorithm that can determine whether a function is constant or balanced with only one query, whereas a classical algorithm would require multiple queries. To extend the Deutsch-Josza algorithm for testing properties such as linearity or monotonicity, we need to modify the problem statement and design a new quantum oracle.

Let's consider the linearity test as an example. Suppose we have a function f(x) that takes a binary string x and returns a binary output. The function is linear if the following condition holds for all x, y:

f(x) + f(y) = f(x ⊕ y)

Here, ⊕ denotes bitwise XOR. We want to design a quantum algorithm to determine if the function is linear or not.

1. Prepare a quantum circuit with n+1 qubits, where n is the length of the binary input string x.

2. Initialize the first n qubits in the state |0⟩ and the last qubit in the state |1⟩.

3. Apply Hadamard gates to all qubits.

4. Design a quantum oracle U_f that acts as follows:
 U_f |x⟩|y⟩ = |x⟩|y ⊕ f(x)⟩
 The oracle should implement the function f(x) on the input qubits x and store the result in the output qubit y.

5. Apply the quantum oracle U_f to the circuit.

6. Apply Hadamard gates to the first n qubits.

7. Measure the first n qubits.

If the measurement results are all 0s, the function is likely linear; otherwise, it's not. Note that this algorithm is probabilistic and may require multiple runs to achieve high confidence in the result.
