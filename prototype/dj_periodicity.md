A quantum algorithm for testing periodicity, we'll adapt the Deutsch-Josza algorithm. The problem we're trying to solve is to determine if a function f(x) is periodic with a non-zero period p, such that f(x) = f(x+p) for all x.

Here's a high-level description of the algorithm:
1. Prepare a quantum circuit with 2n+1 qubits, where n is the length of the binary input string x.
2. Initialize the first n qubits in the state |0⟩, the next n qubits in the state |x⟩, and the last qubit in the state |1⟩.
3. Apply Hadamard gates to the first 2n qubits.
4. Design a quantum oracle U_f that acts as follows:
U_f |x⟩|y⟩|z⟩ = |x⟩|y ⊕ x⟩|z ⊕ f(x) ⊕ f(y)⟩
The oracle should implement the function f(x) on the input qubits x and y and store the result in the output qubit z.
5. Apply the quantum oracle U_f to the circuit.
6. Apply Hadamard gates to the first 2n qubits.
7. Measure the first 2n qubits.
