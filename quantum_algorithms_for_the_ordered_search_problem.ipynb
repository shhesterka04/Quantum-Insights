        "One of the most basic computational problems is the task of finding a desired item in an ordered list of $N$ items. While the best classical algorithm for this problem uses $\\log_2 N$ queries to the list, a quantum computer can solve the problem using a constant factor fewer queries. However, the precise value of this constant is unknown. By characterizing a class of quantum query algorithms for ordered search in terms of a semidefinite program, we find new quantum algorithms for small instances of the ordered search problem. Extending these algorithms to arbitrarily large instances using recursion, we show that there is an exact quantum ordered search algorithm using $4\\log_{605} N \\approx 0.433\\log_2 N$ queries, which improves upon the previously best known exact algorithm."
